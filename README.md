Infiniminer (w/ Plexiglass)
===========

Building
--------

~~Building Infiniminer requires Visual Studio 2008 and XNA Game Studio 3.0.~~

Strike that - you'll need 2015 and 4.0 - eventually I hope to port this mess to Mono for that sweet cross-platform.

You'll also need the fonts 04b03b and 04b08 from [here](http://www.dsg4.com/04/extra/bitmap/)

Simply build the solution and you should be good to go.

Issues
------

As Zach no longer has an offical repository for the game, this is where you'll put all your problems! 

Just go to our [issues](https://github.com/CalmBit/infiniminer/issues) page!
